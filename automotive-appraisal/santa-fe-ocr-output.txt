Vehicle Valuation Methodology Explanation

WorkCenter Total Loss (“WCTL”) was designed and built by Mitchell International, Inc. in conjunction with J.D. Power, which is an expert
in data analysis with years of experience in vehicle pricing. WCTL provides a consistent methodology across vehicle makes and models
for estimating the value of a vehicle. The WCTL analysis is based on comparable vehicles that most closely resemble the loss vehicle,
with certain adjustments to both the comparable vehicle and loss vehicle depending on the facts of a particular claim.

WCTL produces accurate and easy-to-understand vehicle valuations via a five-step process:

Step 1 - Locate Comparable Vehicles

Locate vehicles from WCTL'’s comparable vehicle database that are the closest match to the loss vehicle in the same market area. These
are not intended to be replacement vehicles and may no longer be listed for sale .The comparable vehicle database includes millions of
vehicles listed for sale on publicly available websites (for example, cars.com and autotrader.com), as well as sold vehicle records (where
available).

Step 2 - Adjust Comparable Vehicles

Make adjustments to the prices of the comparable vehicles. There are several types of comparable vehicle adjustments, including:

+ Projected Sold Adjustment - where the comparable vehicle is listed for sale, this adjustment reflects the fact that consumers
typically negotiate a purchase price less than the list price. (There is no projected sold adjustment where the comparable
vehicle has actual sold data, or where a vehicle is listed for sale at a “no haggle” dealership.)

+ Mileage Adjustment — an adjustment for differences in mileage between the comparable vehicle and the loss vehicle.

» Equipment Adjustment — an adjustment for differences in equipment between the comparable vehicle and the loss vehicle
(for example, differences in equipment packages and options).

Step 3 - Calculate Base Vehicle Value

Calculate the base vehicle value by averaging the adjusted prices of the comparable vehicles.
Step 4 - Calculate Loss Vehicle Adjustments

There are four types of loss vehicle adjustments:

« Condition Adjustment — an adjustment to account for the condition of the loss vehicle at the time of the loss.

» Prior Damage Adjustment — an adjustment to account for any prior damage present on the loss vehicle at the time of the
loss.

» After Market Part Adjustment — an adjustment to account for any aftermarket parts present on the loss vehicle at the time of
the loss.

» Refurbishment Adjustment — an adjustment to account for any refurbishment performed on the loss vehicle at the time of
the loss.

Step 5 - Calculate the Market Value
The Market Value is calculated by applying the loss vehicle adjustments to the base value.
